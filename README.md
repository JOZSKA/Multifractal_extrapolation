# Multifractals
This code can be used for two purposes: 1. (universal) multifractal analysis of a 2D data-set, 2. (stochastic) downscaling of the data-set to smaller scales. 
All the essential universal multifractal properties for a 2D distributions are provided in the multifractal class (module multifractal_class_pub). The downscaling is provided by the core field extrapolation function (module field_extrapolation_pub).
