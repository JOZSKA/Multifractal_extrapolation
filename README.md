# Multifractals
This code can be used for two purposes: 1. (universal) multifractal analysis of a 2D data-set, 2. (stochastic) downscaling of the data-set to smaller scales. All the essential universal multifractal properties for 2D distributions are provided in the multifractal class (module multifractal_class_pub). The downscaling is provided by the core field extrapolation function (module field_extrapolation_pub).

General purpose: At various ranges of scales one can frequently demonstrate that physical, biological (or otherwise) variables have a stochastic symmetry of scale-invariance. Moreover, it can be frequently argued that the symmetry of scale-invariance is a continuous symmetry. Mathematically this (together with stability) implies that the stochastic model (consequently the PDF for the variables) can be parametrized by only three scaling parameters (universal multifractals). This surprisingly simple structure behind the complex looking distributions is analysed and used by this code.

To find the multifractal properties for a distribution ``rho'', all you need is to plug rho into the Multifractals class. Then you just extract the multifractal attributes of your interest (i.e rho.fluxes, rho.increments_scaling , rho.UM_parameters). (Note the UM parameters attribute provides one with three scaling parameters (H, alpha, C1) and furthermore with scale of flux homogeneity, the proportionality constant for the fluctuations scaling and the relative error of the UM fit. (All in the given order.) The analysis uses default settings from the multifractal_parameter_values_pub module which can be changed as suits the user.

One can then use the scale-invariance of the distribution and assuming that it extends to some smaller scales, one can use the simple PDF to statistically extrapolate the distribution values to smaller scales. This is a  handy tool how to improve model resolution (in a stochastic sense), or add some important piece of information about distribution properties (/values) at lower scales.  To stochastically re-distribute the distribution at lower scales on plugs the distribution rho into the field_extrapoaltion function together with the value of number of iterations. The number of iterations identifies the lower scale to which the distribution is downscaled as 'lower scale' = 'scale of data resolution' / 2**(number of iterations). Therefore the following values of numbers of iterations = 1,2,3,4 lead to dowscaling by factors 2,4,8,16 ... . After providing the large-scale-distribution and identifying the scale to which the distribution is going to be extrapolated, the algorith goes as follows: 1. The algorithm identifies the UM parameters and derives the PDF for the UM fluxes using inverse Mellin transform. 2. The algorithm then redistributes the fluxes at the given lower scale. 3. One further obtains a smoothened version of the field distribution at the lower scale. 3. One derives the fluctuation sizes from the fluxes and using an algorithm that randomly connects neighbouring pixels (creating random connected networks) one distributes the values to correspond: a) the fluctuation sizes, b) wheher the fluctuation corresponds to distribution increase, or decrease is determined by the smoothened field.
